She tends to her vegetable garden throughout the seasons, finding comfort in routine planting and harvesting. Quilting and knitting provide her with rhythmic, detail‑oriented creative outlets. Bird‑watching in her backyard satisfies her curiosity while remaining a calm, solitary pursuit. She reads historical fiction, solves crossword puzzles, and joins a small bridge group of four friends where friendly competition appeals to her competitive nature. Volunteering at the local library’s reading program allows her to help in a small, organized setting. \n",

She wishes to complete the unfinished college coursework that will earn her a certificate in business administration, allowing her to mentor younger family members in practical finances. She aims to stay digitally connected with her children and grandchildren by improving her email and video‑call skills. Within her church, she aspires to continue organizing the small‑group fellowship meetings, ensuring they run smoothly and predictably.
